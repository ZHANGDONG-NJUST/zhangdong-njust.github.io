I am a Ph.D. student in [Intelligent Media Analysis Group (IMAG)](https://imag-njust.net/) at Nanjing University of Science and Technology under supervision of Prof. [Jinhui Tang](https://imag-njust.net/jinhui-tang/). During Sep. 2018 to Sep. 2020, I was supported by China Scholarship Council as a joint PhD. student at Nanyang Technological University under supervision of [Hanwang Zhang](https://mreallab.github.io/people.html) and [Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/) in Singapore. Now, my research interests are in machine learning and computer vision, especially in object detection, semantic segmentation, scene parsing, video object segmentation and cross-scene segmentation.
