### About Me
<p align="justify">
I am now a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I work closely with <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng">Prof. Kwang-Ting Cheng</a>. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of CSE from Jan. 2022 to Nov. 2023. Before joining HKUST, I earned my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, where I was supervised by <a href="http://gsmis.njust.edu.cn/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=vXtXlpkb!DG57dx!7t4N7w==&yxsh=4iVdgPyuKTE=&zydm=QP9JvMVDx3k=">Prof. Jinhui Tang</a>. From Sep. 2018 to Sep. 2020, I was supported by the China Scholarship Council as a joint Ph.D. student at MReaL of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. Hanwang Zhang and Prof. Qianru Sun.

<p align="justify">
My primary research interests are in machine learning, computer vision, and medical image analysis, with a focus on fundamental research tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation. In addition, my research interests are also centered on efficient network architecture design for edge devices perception, with an emphasis on developing integrated visual recognition systems tailored for applications such as healthcare and wellness analysis.</p>
