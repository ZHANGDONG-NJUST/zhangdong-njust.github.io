### About Me

<p align="justify">
Now, I am a postdoctoral research scientist at 
<a href="http://vsdl.ust.hk/people.html">Vision and System Design Lab (VSDL)</a>, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology working with <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/tim-kwang-ting-cheng">Prof. Kwang-Ting CHENG</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University of Science and Technology under the supervision of <a href="http://gsmis.njust.edu.cn/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=vXtXlpkb!DG57dx!7t4N7w==&yxsh=4iVdgPyuKTE=&zydm=QP9JvMVDx3k=">Prof. Jinhui Tang</a>. During Sep. 2018 to Sep. 2020, I was supported by China Scholarship Council as a joint Ph.D. student at MReaL of Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of Prof. Hanwang Zhang and Prof. Qianru Sun. </p>

<p align="justify">
My research interests are in machine learning, image processing, computer vision and biomedical image analysis, especially in image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and their potential applications. </p>
